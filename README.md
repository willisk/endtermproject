# endtermproject
This was my end-term project for the course 'Introduction to Computer Science'.

Our task was to create a game where the player has to navigate through a maze filled with static and dynamic obstacles in search for all hidden keys.
Once aquired the player is able to pass through the secret exit and finish the game.

We were given the code for creating random mazes and had to implement game logic, hit collision, a GUI, etc..

The original requirement for the project was to use Lanterna, a character-by-character based GUI, to display the maze on the screen.
I had used Java's Swing Toolkit before to and decided to fare with it for this project.
